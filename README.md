# Credit Risk Resampling

**Background** In this project, I’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

I will be using Machine Learning models that include Logistic Regression, Balanced Random Forest, and a variety of re-sampling techniques are used like (Oversampling) to re-sample the data. Evaluation metrics like the accuracy score, precision score and recall score are generated to compare models and determine which suits this particular set of data best.

**Analysis Purpose**

The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credit worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services.  

**Description of Machine Learning Model**

- Accuracy Score: "95.20%" Meaning we are taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model. 
- Precision Score: "92%" Meaning the predicted positives were 92 percent correct.
- Recall Score: "95%" Meaning the model was 95 percent precise in measuring the true positive values of the predictions made.

## Summary 

---

I would recommend using this model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, because it has over 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. That accuracy range could be easily molded into a business risk profile to ensure sufficient capital flow for the lenders to remain in business/make a profit.
